# OpenAI-gym-frozenlake
Custom Frozen Lake Reinforcement Learning Project
Project Overview
This project encompasses three distinct implementations of reinforcement learning agents in the "Frozen Lake" environment from the Gymnasium library. Each script introduces a unique variation of the environment, demonstrating the flexibility and applicability of reinforcement learning techniques in varied settings.

Scripts
CustomFrozenLakeEnv: Enhances the standard Frozen Lake environment with a customizable map.
FrozenLakeTraining: Implements a Q-learning agent trained on the 4x4 or 8x8 standard Frozen Lake maps, with the option to toggle the 'slippery' condition.
CustomFrozenLakeEnvRandom: Introduces a dynamically generated Frozen Lake environment with random placements of holes and bonus tiles, adding complexity to the navigation task.
